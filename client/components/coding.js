          cycling, reading fantasy novels, fashion, music festivals, hiking, and
          checking out museums and art exhibits. Plus, I'm always on the hunt
          for interesting new restaurants and bubble tea shops.

          In early 2019, I realized that I had gone as far as I could on my
          previous career path and began searching for new challenges to spark
          creativity and growth. I was hunting for ways to develop, both
          personally and professionally, and grew curious about the technology
          industry and learning to code. I was surprised to find how much I
          enjoyed tinkering, building and creating through code.
